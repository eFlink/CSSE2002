# CSSE2002

These assignments showcase my work in the CSSE2002 Programming in the large class, which focused on developing disciplined practices for maintaining large and complex software systems. The course emphasized well-specifying, well-implementing, and well-testing software, covering concepts such as object-oriented programming, genericity, exception handling, and their application to file IO and GUIs in Java. Throughout the course, I gained knowledge in these areas, including the importance of thorough code testing through creating tests and utilizing SVN. Rather than starting from scratch, my assignments involved enhancing existing code by adding specific functionalities, allowing me to develop skills in code comprehension, code organization, and generating Java documentation while also utilizing and analyzing existing documentation.
